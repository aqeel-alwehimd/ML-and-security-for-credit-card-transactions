# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project  

### Overview  
This project shows my usage of supervised machine learning to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a structuresd tabular dataset from Kaggle. The workflow demonstrates end-to-end ML methodology: exploratory data analysis, class imbalance handling, model selection, validation curves, learning curves, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation using real-world-relevant metrics.  

Repository Structure:

- README.md # Project overview & documentation
- Revision_report.pdf # Full project report for future reference
- analysis.ipynb # Jupyter notebook for analysis and overall data understanding with visualizations
- data # https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dhanushnarayananr/credit-card-fraud
- model_optimisation.ipynb # Python scripts for modelling and different visuals (density plots, learning and validation curves, confusion matrix)
- model_selection.ipynb # shows the different models compared

### Future Work  
I believe I will focus in the future on linking such concepts and techniques to a real-world noisy datasets and challenge myself to clean and perform feature engineering on the attributes before training, and then implement cost-sensitive learning to simulate financial risk.
